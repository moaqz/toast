## Why I created this component?

I created this toast component primarily for my own projects. I needed a simple, reusable toast notification system that could be easily integrated into any of my personal projects.

I tried other libraries, but most of them were built for specific frameworks, which limits their flexibility and usage across different projects. This component, on the other hand, is built using **Web Components** and **Custom events**, making it framework-independent and easy to integrate into any project, regardless of the tech stack.

> [!WARNING]
> This component is not intended to replace existing, feature-rich toast libraries. It's a lightweight, minimalistic solution designed for developers who need a simple way to implement toast notifications.
